TrackCA is a visualization system developed with the help of ConnectAmericas. Is a system that allows to explore the more relevant contents on ConnectAmericas and how is it distribution of navigation, and what are the countries more active in the platform through the use of a treemap. In addition, the visualization offers the opportunities to explore and navigate the patterns and connections that users who visit through specific contents share in order to discover what are the things that the users have in common, this by using a zoomable icicle. Finally, we will see more general results using a line chart where we will see the trends of visits that content have over time and a statistics box where some key performance indicator will be shown such as average number of visits and average number of content created. This project was developed using techniques of filtering, embedded, and derive data.
  
What, Why and How?
  
TrackCA is system that works with the data of ConnectAmericas, a company that has two databases systemas one on a Drupal MySQL and other on MongoDB, the information is stored in tables. The problem with this data is that because is stored in two different systems the company don't have an easy acces to the information available, this create difficulties at the moement of realize reports and track the navigation and traffic of the contents in the platform. Because of that, these are the three tasks that TrackCA solves. 
  
1) Present the distribution of users navigation in ConnectAmericas content. 
2) Derive the connections that users have in common while exploring the content. 
3) Explore the characteristics of navigation, to determine patterns of use. 
  
TrackCA is a system web based, that thorugh the use of treemap and icicles allow to see the distribution of users naviogations and discover what the users have in common, uses techniques of reducing and filtering in order to navigate in a tree structure of the data derived.
